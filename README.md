# chemical-equation-balance
A Java terminal application which parses chemical equations and balances the efficients of the equation.
Parentheses and nested parentheses are supported, charges are not considered when balancing.

## Algebra
To solve equations, a small algebra engine is implemented. Only algebraic operations directly related to balancing equations were implemented, furthermore certain behavior to of the engine may not be suitable for other applications.
